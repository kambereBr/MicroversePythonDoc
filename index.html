    <p>
      Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, and has a design
      philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably
      using significant whitespace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, making it an attractive choice for rapid application development. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
      including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Python is widely used in a variety of fields, including web development,
        data science, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. It has a large and active community of users, with a wealth of
       libraries and frameworks that make it easy to get started with almost any project.</li>
     <li>Python is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Its readability and concise syntax make
       it a great language for prototyping and testing ideas quickly.</li>

      <header>Getting Started with Python</header>

      <p>
        To get started with Python, you will need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website.
        There are two main versions of Python: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the most recent version and is recommended for new users.
      </p>

        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, making it an attractive choice for rapid application development. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
        including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.
     </p>
     <p>Once you have Python installed, you can start using it in a few different ways:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Interactive interpreter: You can open up a Python interpreter and start typing commands to see their output immediately.
         This is a great way to try out small snippets of code and see how they work.</li>
       <li>Scripts: You can also write Python code in a text editor and save it as a script with a .py extension.
         You can then run the script from the command line by typing "python script.py".</li>
        <li>IDLE (Integrated Development Environment): IDLE is a graphical user interface (GUI) that comes with Python.
          It provides a text editor for writing code and a debugger for finding and fixing errors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability.
        It uses indentation to define blocks of code and has a simple syntax, making it easy for beginners to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some basic elements of Python syntax:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Variables: In Python, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). For example:</li>
      </ul>
      <code>x = 10
        y = "hello"
      </code>
        <ul>
          <li>Data types: Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.
            You can use the built-in function type() to determine the type of a value. For example:</li>
         </ul>
         <code>x = 10
            y = "hello"
            z = True

            print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
            print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'str'>
            print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
          </code>
          <ul>
            <li>Operators: Python has various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. For example:</li>
           </ul>
           <code>x = 10
              y = 20

              # Arithmetic operators
              print(x + y)  # Output: 30
              print(x - y)  # Output: -10
              print(x * y)  # Output: 200
              print(x / y)  # Output: 0.5

              # Comparison operators
              print(x == y)  # Output: False
              print(x > y)   # Output: False
              print(x < y)   # Output: True

              # Logical operators
              print(x > 5 and y < 25)  # Output: True
              print(x > 15 or y < 25)  # Output: True
            </code>

          <header>Data Types</header>
          <p>Python has a variety of data types, including integers,
            floats, strings, and booleans. In this section, we'll cover the basics
            of each data type and how to use them in your code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Integers</li>
            <li>Floats</li>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Booleans</li>
            <li>Type conversion</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="functions" class="main-section">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called from other parts of your program.
              They are an essential part of Python programming, and are used to perform specific tasks or actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Defining a function
              To define a function in Python, you use the def keyword followed by
              the name of the function, a set of parentheses, and a colon.
              The code block that follows is the body of the function, and is indented to show
              that it is part of the function.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Here is an example of a simple function that prints a message to the console:</li>
            </ul>
            <code>def greet():
                  print("Hello, world!")
            </code>

            <p>
              Calling a function
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To call a function in Python, you simply use its name followed by a set of parentheses. For example:</li>
            </ul>
            <code>greet()</code>
            <p>Arguments and parameters
          Functions can accept arguments, which are values that are passed to the function when it is called.
          These arguments are called parameters when they are defined in the function.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Here is an example of a function that takes an argument and prints a message to the console:</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            def greet(name):
              print("Hello, " + name + "!")
          </code>
          <code>
            greet("John")  # prints "Hello, John!"
            greet("Jane")  # prints "Hello, Jane!"
          </code>
